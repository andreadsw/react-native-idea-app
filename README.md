# Basic ideadpad App with Firebase
This app gives access to users through Firebase authentication as well as covers the CRUD operations: creating, listing, updating and delete ideas in the app. This app is developed with React Native and Redux (State management). 
Using JavaScript, you can build a truly native application that renders native UI components and accesses native device functionality. React Native apps can be publishing in the App Store and PlayStore using the same code. This app was only tested on iOS simulator, not in Android Studio.
